  Simple Linear Regression Model:

Here we have a Simple Linear Regression Model for the 
Dataset "Salary_Data" which is the dataset of Salary 
based on years of Experience of the Employee. So, this 
model helps to predict the expected salary for the 
employee based on No of years of experience.


  My work flow:

--Importing libraries
--Importing dataset
--splitting dataset into training set and test set
--fitting simple linear regression to the training set
--predicting test set results
--visualising training set results
--visualising test set result
